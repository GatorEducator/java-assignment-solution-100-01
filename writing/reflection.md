# Reflection by Gregory M. Kapfhammer

Copied from the README.md: This assignment requires a programmer to implement
and test a Java program, called `DisplayOutput`, that will produce four lines of
output. The first line of output will contain the name of the programmer and the
date at which the program was run. The next three lines of output will feature
any one-sentence and one-line statements of advice that the programmer would
like to provide to the person using the program. The source code for the
`DisplayOutput` program must adhere to all of the requirements in the [Google
Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). The
output should produce a certain number of lines. All of the written contain
should contain at least one paragraph and a total of 200 words. If there are not
the correct number of words or commits in the repository, then the build will
fail. Ultimately, the student must write this entire paragraph. All of the
checking will be performed through the use of a single Gradle plugin. More
details about this assignment are available in the README.md file. Students will
see where they have to reflect by looking for some of the icons that are now
included in the assignment sheet that is given as a PDF. Okay, enough content!
